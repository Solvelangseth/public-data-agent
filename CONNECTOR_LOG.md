# Connector log

Written by the connector lane, read by the query lane. One entry per connector
attempted, whether or not it worked, newest at the bottom. The format is in
`CRAWL_BRIEF.md`.

A connector that cannot return data is a result worth writing down: it stops the same
one being attempted twice, and a domain full of dead endpoints is a finding about the
domain.

Written by the query lane as the worked example. Commits `6ef054d`, `42d91aa`.

**Endpoints.** `https://statistikk-data.fhi.no/api/open/v1`
`/Common/source` lists 13 registers · `/{register}/Table` lists that register's tables ·
`/{register}/Table/{id}/dimension?includeValues=true` gives the shape ·
`POST /{register}/Table/{id}/data` returns json-stat2.

**Shape.** `observation`. 369 tables; 119 of them (all in the `nokkel` register) carry a
`GEO` dimension. Geography is printed as Klass codes — 36 of the 42 codes in Klass 1168
appear verbatim — so the rows share a vocabulary with SSB.

**Capability recorded.** `observations`, verified against real returned cells on a live
run. A register's `/Table` listing URL is *not* data: it returns table ids, and the
original connector stored those as observation values.

**Surprises.**
- json-stat2 permits `category.index` as an object *or* an array. SSB emits the object,
  FHI the array. Our decoder handled only the object, so a conforming payload looked
  unsupported. Fixed for both decoders in `6ef054d`.
- Every dimension must be filtered explicitly or the API returns 400. This is a feature:
  an accidental whole-table pull is impossible and the error names the dimension you
  missed.
- `GEO` nests bydel under kommune under fylke, so the category tree has to be walked.
- Labels differ from Klass where the codes agree (`Bydel Grünerløkka` against
  `Grünerløkka`). Join on codes; names would silently match nothing.
- `:` means a withheld cell, not a number. It now goes in `records.suppressed`.
- Rate limit is ~2 requests/second. Four unthrottled workers produced 123 HTTP 429s that
  looked exactly like 123 broken tables.

**Open question for the query side.** None.
